# Overview
This is an implementation of a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller which uses IsaacGym as a dynamic model for the rollouts. We provide several examples of what tasks you can solve with it:

You can extend the repository with your robots and tasks since it is designed to be modular and reusable.

# Installation

*NOTE: To use the GPU pipeline (default) you need an NVIDIA graphics card. If you do not have one, you can use the CPU pipeline, with fewer samples.*

This project requires the source code of IsaacGym inside the folder
`thirdparty`. Download it from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym, extract it, and place
it in `mppi-isaac/thirdparty`. Then you can proceed with the installation described below. 

## Virtual environment (advised)
You can install the necessary dependencies using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) virtual environment. After installing poetry, move into `mppi-isaac` and run
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```
Bear in mind that the installation might take several minutes the first time. But it's worth it.

Access the virtual environment using
```bash
poetry shell
```

### Virtual environment - Pycharm
If you are using Pycharm (professional), first add a new Python interpreter via 'Add New Interpreter', 'Add local interpreter" and 
create a virtual environment within the mppi-isaac folder called 'venv'. Then install the necessary dependencies using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) in the virtual environment.
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

### **Test the installation**
Test that everything is properly set up, use pytest
```bash
cd examples
poetry run pytest
```
## System-level installation
Alternatively, you can also install at the system level using pip, even though we advise using the virtual environment:
```bash
pip install .
```

## Troubleshooting
If you have an Nvidia card and after running the simulation you get a black screen, you might need to force the use of the GPU card through ``export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json``. Run this command from the same folder as the script to be launched for every terminal

# Running the examples
Access the virtual environment if installed with poetry (with `poetry shell`). You can run two types of examples, either the ones using IsaacGym or the ones using Pybullet. In the `examples` folder, you find all the scripts. 

## IsaacGym examples
To run the examples with IsaacGym (`panda`, `heijn_push`, `boxer_push`, `albert` and more), you need two terminals because it is required to run a "server" and a "client" script. In the first one run the server:
```bash 
python3 world.py
```
In the second one the client:
```bash 
python3 planner.py
```

## Pybullet examples
In some older branches, you can run one of the example scripts which use Pybullet, for instance for the panda robot:
```bash
python3 panda_robot_with_obstacles.py
```
